## AREA 24: SECURITY HARDENING (from full-stack code review — 2026-05-02)

### 24-A: CRITICAL — Authentication & Token Backdoors

24.1  [DONE] Security: Gate VisualTestAuthMiddleware behind Development env + ASP_SEED_PROFILE=Visual; reject "Bearer visual_*" in all other environments (VisualTestAuthMiddleware.cs)
24.2  [DONE] Security: Remove committed JWT fallback key "LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT_JWT_FALLBACK_32_CHARS_MIN"; generate ephemeral random 32-byte key on dev startup, require User Secrets (JwtSigningKeyResolver.cs)
24.3  [DONE] Security: Remove DB passwords from appsettings.Development.json and appsettings.json; enforce env-var / User Secrets only (appsettings.*.json)
24.4  [DONE] Security: Add [Authorize] attribute to ChatHub class (ChatHub.cs)
24.5  [DONE] Security: Add [Authorize] attribute to NotificationHub class; gate JoinBatch/JoinDepartment to authenticated callers (NotificationHub.cs)
24.6  [DONE] Security: Replace non-thread-safe Dictionary<string,string> in ChatHub with ConcurrentDictionary; support multi-device per user (ChatHub.cs)

### 24-B: CRITICAL — Sensitive Data in Responses

24.7  [DONE] API: Do not return DefaultPassword in ApproveMember HTTP response; send via email only, return PasswordEmailed: true flag (AdminController.cs)
24.8  [DONE] API: Do not return ResetUrl (containing reset token) in ResetPasswordAdmin response; force email-only delivery (AdminController.cs)
24.9  [DONE] API: Do not return ClientSecret/GatewaySecretKey in AdminSocialAuthController.GetConfigs or PaymentConfigController responses; mask or omit secrets (AdminSocialAuthController.cs, PaymentConfigController.cs)

### 24-C: CRITICAL — Payment Gateway Security

24.10 [DONE] Payment: Implement HMAC/signature verification on bKash webhook before trusting paymentID (BkashGateway.cs ProcessWebhookAsync)
24.11 [DONE] Payment: Implement verify_sign HMAC check on SSLCommerz webhook; verify store_passwd hash against all callback fields (SSLCommerzGateway.cs VerifyCallbackAsync)
24.12 [DONE] Payment: Verify executed payment amount against the originating PaymentHistory amount for bKash (BkashGateway.cs VerifyCallbackAsync)
24.13 [DONE] Payment: Add idempotency — store paymentID/val_id in PaymentHistory with UNIQUE constraint; short-circuit on duplicate callback (both gateways)
24.14 [DONE] Payment: Fix HttpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders mutation race in BkashGateway (3 call sites); use per-request HttpRequestMessage headers (BkashGateway.cs)
24.15 [DONE] Payment: Derive CallbackUrl exclusively from server-side config (AppSettings:PublicApiBaseUrl), never from request.BaseUrl supplied by the client (GatewaysController.cs)
24.16 [DONE] Payment: Replace hardcoded fee fallback of 500 BDT and adminId fallback of "1" with startup-time config validation that fails loudly (GatewaysController.cs)
24.17 [DONE] Payment: Fix SSLCommerz form body parser — split on '=' truncates base64 values; use QueryHelpers.ParseQuery instead (SSLCommerzGateway.cs ProcessWebhookAsync)

### 24-D: CRITICAL — File & Path Security

24.18 [DONE] Security: Fix path traversal in SecureFilesController — after Path.GetFullPath, assert path starts with the secure-uploads root; reject any path containing ".." (SecureFilesController.cs)

### 24-E: CRITICAL — OTP Service

24.19 [DONE] Security: Replace new Random() with RandomNumberGenerator.GetInt32(100_000, 1_000_000) for cryptographically secure OTP generation (OtpService.cs)
24.20 [DONE] Security: Store OTP as HMAC-SHA256(code, email), not cleartext; a DB compromise reveals all active codes (OtpService.cs)
24.21 [DONE] Security: Add per-email attempt counter — lock OTP after 5 wrong attempts; add Purpose field (EmailVerify, PasswordReset) to prevent cross-use (OtpService.cs)
24.22 [DONE] Security: Invalidate all previous unverified OTPs for the same email before inserting a new one (OtpService.cs)

### 24-F: HIGH — Authentication Service

24.23 [DONE] Security: Add brute-force lockout to LoginAsync — track FailedLoginAttempts + LockoutUntil on User, lock 15 min after 5 failures (AuthService.cs)
24.24 [DONE] Security: Fix username enumeration timing attack — always run a dummy BCrypt.Verify when user is not found to normalize response time (AuthService.cs)
24.25 [DONE] Security: Fix social auto-link — only link IdP email to local account when member.EmailVerified == true (AuthService.cs SocialLoginAsync)
24.26 [DONE] Security: Social signup uses unique SOCIAL-{PROVIDER}-{socialId} sentinel instead of "TBD" for NID/MobileNo — prevents UNIQUE index crash on second social signup (AuthService.cs SocialLoginAsync)
24.27 [DONE] Security: JWT lifetime reduced to 60 min; opaque refresh token (SHA-256 hash stored in RefreshTokens table, 7-day cookie rotation) implemented in TokenService.cs + RefreshToken entity + /auth/refresh endpoint
24.28 [DONE] Security: Rotate SecurityStamp on password reset and password change to invalidate all previous JWTs (AuthService.cs, UserService.cs)

### 24-G: HIGH — Data Integrity (MemberService)

24.29 [DONE] Bug: Fix membership number lexicographic race — OrderByDescending(m.Id) instead of string sort; prevents regression at 999→1000 rollover (MemberService.cs RegisterAsync + ApproveMemberAsync)
24.30 [DONE] Bug: Replace hard-delete of rejected applicants with soft-delete (Status=Rejected, IsArchived=true) preserving audit trail; added Rejected to MembershipStatus enum (MemberService.cs, Enums.cs)
24.31 [DONE] Bug: CreateUserAccountAsync moved inside the serializable transaction in ApproveMemberAsync — member+user are now atomic (MemberService.cs)
24.32 [DONE] Perf: BulkArchiveInactiveMembersAsync replaced N+1 ArchiveMemberAsync loop with bulk ExecuteUpdateAsync calls for all cascades (MemberService.cs)

### 24-H: HIGH — Missing DB Indexes

24.33 [DONE] Perf: Add index on User.MemberId (hot lookup path in Auth, Member services)
24.34 [DONE] Perf: Add partial index on User.ResetToken WHERE ResetToken IS NOT NULL
24.35 [DONE] Perf: Add index on User.GoogleId, User.FacebookId (social login hot path)
24.36 [DONE] Perf: Add composite index on Otp(Email, ExpiryAt) — OTP verification scans table without it
24.37 [DONE] Perf: Add composite index on Member(Status, IsArchived) — heavily filtered in admin listing queries (MemberConfiguration.cs)
24.38 [DONE] Perf: Add entity configuration file for Otp table (currently using EF defaults — no indexes, no column length caps on a security-critical table)

### 24-I: HIGH — Frontend (Angular)

24.39 [DONE] Security: Move JWT from localStorage to httpOnly + Secure + SameSite=Strict cookie set by backend; token no longer stored in localStorage; Angular uses /auth/me on init; sessionStorage holds display fields only (auth.service.ts, ServiceExtensions.cs, AuthController.cs)
24.40 [DONE] Security: Wrap getUserFromStorage() JSON.parse in try/catch; fall back to null and clear corrupt entry (auth.service.ts)
24.41 [DONE] Security: Check JWT exp claim on storage restore — drop session if token is already expired (auth.service.ts)
24.42 [DONE] Security: Sanitize article HTML server-side with Ganss.HtmlSanitizer before storage in NewsService.CreateNewsAsync + UpdateNewsAsync; [innerHTML] now safe (NewsService.cs, magazine.html)
24.43 [DONE] Security: Restrict Authorization header injection in globalHttpInterceptor to /api/* URLs only, not all outgoing HttpClient requests (global-http.interceptor.ts)
24.44 [DONE] Security: Token refresh implemented — 401 queuing with BehaviorSubject, POST /auth/refresh retried, all concurrent 401s share single refresh call, logout only on refresh failure (global-http.interceptor.ts, AuthController.cs)
24.45 [DONE] Security: Client-side file validation added — images ≤ 5 MB (JPEG/PNG/WebP), PDFs ≤ 10 MB; shared validateUploadFile() utility applied to register.ts, gallery.ts, admin-members.ts, admin-events.ts, articles.ts (file-validation.util.ts)
24.46 [DONE] Security: Enforce mustChangePassword redirect — after login, route to change-password screen before allowing any navigation (auth.service.ts, auth.guard.ts)

### 24-J: HIGH — API Controller Hardening

24.47 [DONE] Security: Restrict QueryStringTokenMiddleware to GET-only on /api/secure-files/ and /api/uploads/ paths (QueryStringTokenMiddleware.cs)
24.48 [DONE] Security: PartitionedRateLimiter keyed on (IP, username) for login endpoint; LoginRateLimitMiddleware peeks body username before rate limiter runs (Program.cs, LoginRateLimitMiddleware.cs)
24.49 [DONE] Security: Add startup validator that throws if AllowedOrigins is empty in Production (Program.cs)
24.50 [DONE] Security: Use int.TryParse for MemberId claim parsing; return Unauthorized on missing/invalid claim (PollController.cs, FamilyLinkController.cs)
24.51 [DONE] Security: Read admin identity from User.FindFirst("MemberId") JWT claim in ApproveMember and RejectMember (AdminController.cs)

### 24-K: MEDIUM — Validator & Input Hardening

24.52 [DONE] Validation: Add MaximumLength and safe-character regex to FatherName, MotherName, PresentAddress, PermanentAddress, EmergencyContactName, EmergencyContactRelation, EmergencyContactPhone in MemberRegistrationValidator (MemberRegistrationValidator.cs)
24.53 [DONE] Validation: Add EmergencyContactPhone format validation (same regex as MobileNo) (MemberRegistrationValidator.cs)
24.54 [DONE] Validation: Add minimum age gate (LessThan(UtcNow.AddYears(-13))) and sanity lower bound (GreaterThan(UtcNow.AddYears(-120))) to DateOfBirth (MemberRegistrationValidator.cs)
24.55 [DONE] Validation: Add MaximumLength(254) to Email in VerifyEmailValidator; add caps to AcademicHistory.Subject and Result fields (MemberRegistrationValidator.cs, VerifyEmailValidator.cs)
24.56 [DONE] Validation: Enforce AdmissionYear < PassingYear in academic record child rules (MemberRegistrationValidator.cs)

### 24-L: MEDIUM — CSP & Security Headers

24.57 [DONE] Security: Remove 'unsafe-inline' from script-src in CSP header; use nonces or hashes (SecurityHeadersMiddleware.cs)
24.58 [DONE] Security: Register SecurityHeadersMiddleware before UseStaticFiles so static file responses also receive security headers (Program.cs)
24.59 [DONE] Security: Remove deprecated X-XSS-Protection header (SecurityHeadersMiddleware.cs)
24.60 [DONE] Security: Add window.open(..., '_blank', 'noopener,noreferrer') to all gallery/event external link openings to prevent tab-napping (gallery.ts, events.ts)

## AREA 29: FULL-STACK REVIEW FINDINGS (2026-07-24)

> Source: whole-project review (backend correctness + security, Angular web, Flutter mobile, payment audit).
> Cross-referenced against docs/BUSINESS_FINDINGS.md and .antigravity/skills standards.
> Type-check + flutter analyze both pass clean — all items below are runtime/logic/UX, not compile errors.
> Fix order: 29-A blockers first, then 29-F.1 (audit-trail) + 29-B.2 (amount bypass), then 29-F sweep, then 29-G, then 29-C.

### 29-A: CRITICAL — SHIP-BLOCKERS

29A.1 [DONE 2026-07-25] Web: Added /portal/change-password route + ChangePassword component; authGuard now URL-bypasses that page to avoid a redirect loop, and auth.service.clearMustChangePassword() clears the flag on success. (guard spec 7/7)
29A.2 [DONE 2026-07-25] Mobile: session_manager._handleSessionExpiry now clears the REAL secure-storage token via storageService.clearAll() (was only removing a stale SharedPreferences 'jwt_token'); authStateProvider's 2s poll then sees null and the router redirects to /login. (flutter analyze clean)
29A.3 [DONE 2026-07-25] Mobile: digital_id_screen now reads data['membershipNumber'] (was data['membershipId']) and data['passingYear'] (was data['batch']) across QR/barcode/share/PDF/filename — no more literal "PENDING".
29A.4 [DONE 2026-07-25] API: EventService capacity now counts slot-consuming registrations (Pending+Approved, not just Approved), rejects when full and HasWaitlist=false (was skipping the cap entirely), and closes the overfill race with a deterministic post-insert Id-ordinal re-check that demotes/rejects the overflow. (+regression test)
29A.5 [DONE 2026-07-25] API: CheckInParticipantAsync + CheckInByTicketCodeAsync now reject any non-Approved registration (Pending/Rejected/Waitlisted can no longer check in or earn points). (+regression test)

### 29-B: HIGH — SECURITY

29B.1 [TODO] API: Facebook login does not verify token app_id → account takeover; mirror the Google verification path (AuthService.cs:189-217)
29B.2 [DONE 2026-07-25] API: Amount-verification bypass fixed. HandleSuccessfulPayment now takes `decimal? confirmedAmount`; check is `if (confirmedAmount.HasValue && Math.Abs(payment.Amount - confirmedAmount.Value) > 0.01m)` → mark payment Failed + return. SSLCommerz/DGePay callbacks now pass `null` when the amount key is ABSENT (skip verification, VerifyCallbackAsync remains primary gate) vs the parsed value — incl. 0 — when PRESENT (verify). Regression test SSLCommerzCallback_MarksFailedAndDoesNotApprove_WhenReportedAmountMismatches. (GatewaysController.cs)
29B.3 [DONE 2026-07-25] API: Membership auto-approval now scoped to membership fees only — gate is `if (payment.MemberId > 0 && payment.FinancialCategory == Enums.FinancialCategory.MembershipFee)`. FinancialCategory is set at initiation (RegistrationFee for EVT-REG refs, else MembershipFee), so event payments no longer trigger member approval. (GatewaysController.cs)
29B.4 [TODO] API: JWT accepted in query string on file routes → token leaks to proxy logs / Referer (QueryStringTokenMiddleware.cs:29-37)
29B.5 [TODO] API: Password-spray gap — limiter keyed per {ip}:{username}, one IP sprays unlimited accounts (Program.cs:64-75)
29B.6 [TODO] API: Signatures stored in public upload tree (served with no auth) — move to secure_uploads, forgery risk (LocalFileStorageService.cs:42-45)
29B.7 [TODO] API: record-payment receipt uploads not content-validated (Register/Profile paths are) (FinancialService.cs:92-114)
29B.8 [TODO] API: Confirm SecureFilesController root — computed as .../uploads but secure files live under secure_uploads/ (likely rejects legitimate reads)

### 29-C: HIGH — BACKEND CORRECTNESS

29C.1 [TODO] API: Duplicated buggy approval path in FinancialService — lexicographic membership-number sort (collides at #1000), no transaction, skips payment/profile checks; consolidate onto MemberService path (FinancialService.cs:240-246)
29C.2 [TODO] API: GetMemberDocumentsAsync NRE → 500 on non-existent id (MemberService.cs:851-859)

### 29-D: HIGH — WEB (Angular)

29D.1 [TODO] Web: Article rejection crashes — [(ngModel)] bound to a signal → "rejectReason is not a function" (article-approval.html:97)
29D.2 [TODO] Web: Admins approve members blind — approval panel maps only 8 fields, no detail fetch (academic/professional/NID/addresses blank) (member-approval.ts:58-66)
29D.3 [TODO] Web: Chat dead after reload — token in-memory only, sends silently dropped (chat.service.ts:41-42)
29D.4 [TODO] Web: Payments page infinite spinner on error — nested subscribes, no error callback (payments.ts:48-60)
29D.5 [TODO] Web: Digital-ID download is a fake setTimeout stub; real getIDCard() unused (digital-id.ts:35-41)
29D.6 [TODO] Web: Gallery empty <img [src]=""> triggers spurious request (gallery.html:42)
29D.7 [TODO] Web: Router-event subscription leaks in all 3 layouts (unsubscribe on destroy)
29D.8 [TODO] Web: Login ignores token expiry/returnUrl; profile update drops fields; governance page has no error handler

### 29-E: HIGH — MOBILE (Flutter)

29E.1 [TODO] Mobile: Social login buttons are dead stubs (wire or hide)
29E.2 [TODO] Mobile: Error-swallowing services render failures as empty lists (surface errors)
29E.3 [TODO] Mobile: NotificationHub stream/SignalR leaks — Provider not autoDispose
29E.4 [TODO] Mobile: Dropdown service re-fetches every keystroke (debounce/cache)
29E.5 [TODO] Mobile: bool.fromEnvironment('dart.library.js_util') always false — should be kIsWeb

### 29-F: CROSS-CUTTING THEMES (repeat offenders)

29F.1 [DONE 2026-07-25] Web/Mobile: Admin-ID attribution — server already resolves the acting admin from the JWT MemberId claim (item 24.51, AdminController), ignoring any client-supplied id, so this was client-side dead/misleading code, not live audit corruption. Removed the hardcoded adminId=1 fallbacks and the now-unused approvedByAdminId/rejectedByAdminId fields across web (admin.service, member-approval, admin-members + specs), mobile (admin_service.dart), e2e helper, and DTOs (ApproveMemberDto/RejectMemberDto).
29F.2 [TODO] All: Silent-failure sweep — next-only .subscribe() (web) + try/catch-return-empty (mobile) turn errors into blank screens / stuck spinners; add error handlers app-wide
29F.3 [DONE] All: Date contract settled — ISO-8601 is canonical wire format; dd-MM-yyyy is display/input only.
              API unchanged (Write=ISO, Read accepts both). Web: added core/utils/date.util.ts (toDisplayDate/toWireDate/parseDisplayDate); routed 9 write-path components + register.ts through toWire; type-check clean.
              Mobile: AppUtils hardened ISO-first + added toWire(); fixed 6 send sites incl. RegisterModel.toJson DOB; flutter analyze clean.
              Skill doc ghcaa-date-standard/SKILL.md rewritten to the two-format contract. (2026-07-25)
29F.4 [TODO] Web: White-labeling half-wired — nav shows feature-gated links regardless of flags; logos/brand strings hardcoded instead of OrgConfigService; admin layout missing logout/mobile toggle (RELATES TO Area 28)

### 29-G: PAYMENT GAPS (all 5 methods work manually/config-driven; no keys required — these are gaps only)

29G.1 [TODO] Mobile: Dues-payment sheet doesn't surface config methods (bKash/Nagad/Rocket/BankTransfer/ManualReceipt) — only DGePay + a dead Stripe tile
29G.2 [TODO] Mobile: record-payment drops walletNumber/bankName/accountNumber fields
29G.3 [TODO] Web+Mobile: Dead options — remove Stripe tile, NagadGateway stub dropdown entry; CashOnHand uncreatable in UI
29G.4 [TODO] API: /api/gateways/webhook/{gateway} throws unhandled 500 for unregistered gateway — guard the factory (GatewaysController.cs:252-257)
